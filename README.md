### Disclaimer: this is an old version of the program that surely does not compile with the latest compiler versions

Compile with jai source\main.jai, the resulting exe will be in
the bin folder, under the name anim.exe.

This is a program that loads animations and meshes, and renders
them in real time using OpenGL (for now).

This program ships with Blender exporter scripts for animations
and meshes that can be found in the blender folder.

In the data folder are the font, mesh, animation and blend files,
in the source folder are the .jai source files.
